== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to sign-up for a Onsite Messaging account to use this plugin? =
Yes, you can sign-up for a free account at <a href="https://pushalert.co/onsite-messaging/pricing">Onsite Messaging by PushAlert</a> and you will get the Website ID from the Integrate section. Just add the value to the plugin settings and you are all set.

= It doesn't seem to work, I can't see any popup or javascript code. =
If you are using W3 Total Cache, SuperCache or any other cache plugin, you would need to first purge the cache once after the plugin has been configured. CloudFlare or any other CDN must also be purged once for the plugin to work.

= What is a session and how they are calculated? =
A session starts when the user first visits any page on your website until they leave or stop using the site. Therefore, whenever a user closes your site on their browser their session is terminated, and if they come back a new session starts.

= What if I reach my monthly quota of sessions? =
If you cross the session limit of your plan, your campaigns will be paused. You can either upgrade to a plan with higher session limit or you can wait for the next month when your session limit resets. The limit resets every month to your plan defaults.
